# Ideas

### revive body pull
- Get Revive mod corpse pulling to work with shovels
- New Revive Item / Block process where reviving comes with a big downside
   - Knife Item and vial to collect blood from entities -> Store blood type in nbt
   - drag bodies on blocks which are allowed to revive (e.g. marble?)
   - revive with constant blood loss (use ointment & bandage)
   - revive with somewhat long-lasting status effect based on blood type

### drop pot
- item holding inventory
- drops straight to the ground if released
- releases inventory or status effect
- feature renderer on hip if in inventory
- color provider?
