### Overview
This mod was initially created to add easter egg items for a German Minecraft medieval RP server project which is closed by now. However i have kept working on more content for me and the other players from that project and continued to expand this mod for that reason.

This mod gets new features and content for the versions that the new project and spiritual successor of the old project needs.

### What does **"NeMuelch"** mean?
The name **"ne Muelch?"** (asking someone if they want to have a milk in german and with weird pronounciation) has been a meme from that old server project and stuck with this mod ever since.
The initial goal of this mod was to add additional milk items with cursed crafting recipe and favorable side effects but also got new features like admin tools and player related content.

---
### Content
- Admin tools (tools for manual dungeon management, visual and audio additions, ...)
- Player related content (Canes, Wands, Gloves, Supporting Consumables, ...)
- Quality of life imrpovements (recipes, respawn mechanics, vanilla item reworks, ...)
